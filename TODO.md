1. Getting my example gems in and deploying them
2. Figuring out what we're going to do with scaffolding
3. Writing the agents file (a lot with stuff like the star guide, architecture, and the kind of platform that sorts of thing)
4. The README
5. How we're going to think about scaffolding a kind of scaffolds project
6. We could add BMAD-like documentation, and in AGENTS.md put a reference to it as an index
