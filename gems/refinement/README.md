## Knowledge Base Setup

This gem works with a knowledge base to provide domain-specific knowledge, expertise, patterns, and best practices. The knowledge base is referenced during workflow execution to inform suggestions and technical guidance.

**Customizing your knowledge base:**

You can customize the knowledge base by editing `lib/core/data/base.knowledge-base.csv` directly, or by adding it to a Google Sheet before adding it as a knowledge file to the gem and configuring it there.
